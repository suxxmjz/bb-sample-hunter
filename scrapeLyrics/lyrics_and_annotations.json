He awoke one night while staying in a London attic for the filming of Help!:\n\nI got out of bed, sat at the piano, found G, found F sharp minor 7th – and that leads you through then to B to E minor, and finally back to E. It all leads forward logically. I liked the melody a lot, but because I’d dreamed it, I couldn’t believe I’d written it. I thought, ‘No, I’ve never written anything like this before.’ But I had the tune, which was the most magic thing!\n\nThe melody came to McCartney much quicker than lyrical inspiration. In order to arrange the song, he quickly scribbled out placeholder lyrics. Thus, “Yesterday” originally had the working title “Scrambled Eggs,” and opened with:\n\nScrambled eggs\nOh my baby, how I love your legs\n\nMcCartney would subsequently write “Yellow Submarine” in bed, and John Lennon would also stumble upon “Nowhere Man” and “Across The Universe” in dreams. McCartney would later observe:\n\nWhen you’re trying to write a song, there are certain times when you get the essence, it’s all there. It’s like an egg being laid – not a crack or a flaw in it."

We wanted to just take it to another level—because we felt like there was just something that wasn’t there. But it was a great hook. So we add on “no diggity, I got to bag it up.” It was also part of a remix we were supposed to do for “I Like the Way You Work” and it was done with LL Cool J. He was saying “I like the way you work, kid, no diggity”—you know, as a rap. We just said ‘we wanna make this into a song.’ And we did that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn1kKBatkE8"

He never expected her to cheat and leave him this way, reinforcing the line “It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?”\n\nThe repetition of the phrase is also sung with a variety of emotions, following the pattern of the stages of grief: Shock/Denial, Pain/Guilt/Anger, Depression/Reflection, and finally Acceptance.

In other words, I do not believe it is an empty suspicion, as stated above. He is able to look at the dismissal of his relationship as destiny, and an opportunity to advance as a person. I agree the irony in calling himself Mr.Brightside when he is assuming the worst (when he has only seen a kiss) is probable as well, but it should be noted that he is actually looking at the bright side of the end of his relationship with a girl. So though it is ironic that he calls himself Mr.Brightside when he is assuming the furthest extent of cheating, he is in actuality Mr.Brightside because he can understand that this relationship has run its course (destiny is calling me)."

Even the idea of such a fleeting connection can’t compare with the memory of her previous one.\n\nThis situation evokes a psychological/neurological term called involuntary memory, defined as a specific type of memory where a sensory or emotional stimulus in the present causes someone to remember a person or situation from their past without prior effort.\n\nIn literature, this concept is best and most famously represented by Marcel Proust’s memory-trigging madeleines from his magnum opus In Search of Lost Time, but it is an idea evoked in many different forms of popular culture, including music.\n\nOne recent musical example is Sam Smith’s “Reminds Me Of You”, which seems to act as a real life experience of the scenario that O'Connor (through Prince’s lyrics) left only in the realm of hypotheticals:\n\nAnd God knows I try\nLooking for lovers at night\nBut each time I do\nIt only reminds me of you\nIt only reminds me of you"

Remember girls, low self esteem – very attractive to men. Guys always go for the low hanging fruit, easy pickings. Second: the lyrics are incredibly complex! You see, the boys are singing ‘You don’t know you’re beautiful, that’s what makes you beautiful.’ But they’ve just told the girl she’s beautiful. So since she now knows it, she’s no longer beautiful!

I shouted ‘you’re not’ and in my mind I was thinking ‘wow, that’s one of the great things about you is that you don’t know how beautiful you are and that’s what makes you beautiful’. I literally wrote down the phrase and then I went to the studio with Rami [Yacoub] and Carl [Falk]. I had the melody of “baby you light up my world like nobody else” in my head and then everything connected.\n\n\n\nRegarding the popularity of the song, Kotecha told Pop Justice that the song isn’t as perfect as One Direction fans claim:\n\n[…] I’ve had artists come up to me and say ‘dude, ‘What Make You Beautiful’ is the perfect song’. I knew that the math was right, but I guess when it’s all together and the voices are on it and it’s mixed it worked out. […] At the last second I changed a couple of lines, like the ‘flip your hair, get you overwhelmed’ bit wasn’t there. That was a juicy line."

He used a similar line on “Shot For Me”.\n\n\n\n“Bending over backwards” has a double meaning as an idiom for putting a lot of effort into helping someone. As well as the more literal sexual meaning.

He recalls it here and automatically combines it with the chorus:\n\nNo, I can’t sleep until I feel your touch\n\nFurthermore, Vegas is a city, known for being “alive” at night. Another reason this song’s story, or the whole album takes place in Vegas are Abel’s\nrepeated references of it, adding to the fact, that he feels at home there.\n\nAbel fears, that he won’t be able to sleep, because he lost his loved one and needs to get her back to finally get sleep. At the end of his journey, he recalls this line. On “Final Lullaby”, the last track off the deluxe version of his album After Hours, Abel tries to accept the fact that he won’t find his love back in that night.\n\nI’m running out of time\nAnd you’ll always be on my mind\n\nAnother explanation could be his habit to be awake late at night, as already mentioned in “Alone Again”:\n\nI’m falling only for the night\n\nA possible reason for him being stressed during the day is his fame and popularity. During the day, Abel is blinded by the lights of police cars, but also by flashing camera lights, representing fame. Therefore, he likes to escape into the night, just like in his record “Snowchild”:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh"

From stage lights to paparazzi camera flashes, he’s been “blinded” by many examples of a wealthy and successful life, and he doesn’t plan on stopping anytime soon. However, his celebrity life often overshadows his deep personal life. On his 2018 song “Privilege,” Abel discusses how many fans and media sources didn’t believe that he could have a real and genuine relationship with a partner because of his status in fame:\n\nThey said our love is just a game, I don’t care what they say\n\nNevertheless, his relationship seems to be real and sound, as he claims that it is the only thing that can keep him peacefully inserted in this lifestyle.\n\nAbel also uses a similar line on “Snowchild,” the fifth track from After Hours:\n\nLeaving, leaving into the night\nNow a nigga leaving, leaving\nLeaving into the night, oh"

One option is that the coast-to-coast part is just one step of the journey, with the second step being the journey from the East Coast to Chicago. The second option is that the coast being referred to is the coast of Lake Michigan, which is Chicago does indeed lie upon. This does seem a bit strange though. Then again, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron are both in fact hydrologically part of Lake Michigan-Huron, which, treated as a single lake, is the world’s largest freshwater lake, and second largest lake after the Caspian Sea. In other words, describing Chicago as a ‘coastal’ city is maybe not quite such a crazy stretch as it seems.

After arriving in a red streetcar, literally named desire, she is appalled by her sister’s poor living quarters and the coarseness of her brother-in-law, Stanley, who Blanche jokes to her sister about flirting with. She stars a relationship with his friend Mitch, though this is cut short as through the course of the play Stanley works to uncover the dark secrets of Blances past, and expose her “loose morels”. The play is likened to a card game, as one of the first scenes, and also the last scene features one of Stanleys ‘poker nights’. The final line reads “This game is seven-card stud”.\n\nMarlon Brando’s portrayal of a muscled, sweaty Stanley Kowalski in the film adaptation, perpetually clad in a tight-fitting tank top or in the process of taking it off, made him a sex symbol. This line likely intends to compare the “smooth operator” to Stanley, whose primordial passions Blanche describes thus:\n\nThousands and thousands of years have passed him right by, and there he is – Stanley Kowalski – survivor of the Stone Age! Bearing the raw meat home from the kill in the jungle! And you – you here – waiting for him! Maybe he’ll strike you or maybe grunt and kiss you!"

                        "plain": "“Smooth Operator” is a seductive and atmospheric track that showcases Sade’s unique blend of jazz, R&B, and pop. The lyrics tell a story of a Western male who is loved in seven languages and is the subject of the narrator’s desire. The song’s setup establishes a lively and cosmopolitan atmosphere, with references to diamond life, city lights, and business nights. The character desires a relationship with this man that will bring them “minimum waste and maximum joy,” which may be interpreted as a sexual reference.\n\nThe confrontation section of the song introduces a license to love and insurance to hold, which could be seen as a desire for a committed and official relationship. The lyrics then state that this license “melts all your memories and change into gold,” which may be interpreted as the character’s orgasmic experience with the man. The song’s resolution acknowledges the character’s desire for the man but ultimately concludes that their request cannot be granted by someone with a cold heart.\n\nOverall, “Smooth Operator” is a beautifully crafted song with poetic and atmospheric lyrics that create a vivid narrative. The combination of Sade’s smooth vocals and the song’s seductive instrumental backing creates an alluring and captivating listening experience."

We were just talking and she said she was packing. She was gonna take the midnight plane to Houston to visit her folks. So, it just stayed with me. After I got off the phone, I sat down and wrote the song probably in about 30 to 45 minutes. Something like that. Didn’t take me long at all, ‘cause I actually used Farrah and Lee as kind of like characters I guess. A girl that comes to L.A. to make it and doesn’t make it and leaves to go back home. The guy goes back with her. Pretty simple little story, but it felt real to me."

I came by four weeks later to hear the songs. I went to his studio in SoHo and sat down to hear the first four tracks. It was a total “where were you” moment. When they played me “Rehab” I remember saying “rewind it, rewind it!” I was in awe. The rest of the album came shortly thereafter.\n\nLater on Amy sent me the track list for Back to Black and I called her and said “There’s only ten songs on here??” She said “I’ve written the record, it’s 10 tracks, that’s what it is.

I turned around and that was the first time I had seen her without the beehive, looking a lot thinner, with a lot of tattoos. It was honestly a change with where she was stylistically. It wasn’t long after that that we started the recording process.\n\nWhen “Rehab” dropped it was just like a newspaper being lit. I wasn’t expecting this song to be the one that did it.

The question is leading (she knows something about why she’s there) and she regresses, focusing on her irritation instead of accepting her vulnerability and telling what she knows about why she is there.

I went from making no money to making comparatively a lot and all I’ve had is problems. Life was simpler when I had no money, when I just barely survived\n\nIn 1996, 2Pac rapped on “Hold Ya Head”:\n\nAnd mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'\n\nIt’s likely that the “Mo' Money, Mo' Problems” chorus, sung by Kelly Price, was written by the song’s co-producer, Stevie J., perhaps with Puffy’s involvement. This trio—Price, Puffy, and Stevie J—also worked together on SWV’s 1997 hit “Can We.”\n\nThe phrase “mo' money” had become very popular thanks to the 1992 Damon Wayans comedy Mo' Money.

The nice payoff now is that a lot of the people I meet who are at the age where they’ve just got a couple of kids and have grown up a bit, settling down, they’ll say to me, “I thought you were really soppy for years, but I get it now! I see what you were doing!”"

Some could even argue the song is more religious than romantic.\n\nThe phrase “the sky that we look upon”, has the accent on the “on” of upon, and the line has become a rock classic.  In actuality we look up on to the sky, because to look upon, we’d have to either be considering the sky in an abstract manner or we’d have to be looking down from a position on high – a position where from this day forward, Mr. Ben E.

There, Redding had some time to reflect on his life. During that time he was at the height of his popularity, as roughly two moths before, he had performed at the legendary Monterey Pop Festival (1967). The docks in Sausalito eventually inspired Redding to write this song, which became his biggest hit.\n\nWhen Otis played the song for producer Steve Cropper, he told him that if a ship rolls, it will take on water and sink. Otis replied, “Hell, Crop, that’s what I want,” and the line stood.\n\n\n\nAllegedly, the houseboat Redding stayed in still exists, even though slight changes have happened throughout the years.

While this meant that he actually had a lot that was about to come his way, it might’ve seemed insignificant to Redding.\n\nCo-writer and guitarist Steve Cropper has noted that the song is “about many things”. The difficulty of coping with fame and being approximately 2000 miles away from his wife and kids might’ve been a factor. Redding also had problems with his voice during the time he conceptualized this song. Eventually, Redding recovered better than expected after the surgery was done. Shortly thereafter, he began writing extra lines and recording the song."

In 1967, he rented a houseboat in the San Francisco (“‘Frisco”) Bay Area, California, while on the break of his King & Queen tour. During that time, Redding had some time to reflect on his career, and life in general. His time there became the inspiration of this song."

While near the destination of Madison, the plane he was in crashed probably due to poor weather on December 10, 1967. Redding died on impact at the young age of 26.\n\nCropper left eventually the whistling in, as it fit the song’s vibe quite well.\n\nWhile most people accredit sideman Sam “Bluzman” Taylor for the whistling, Cropper has debunked this myth by stating that the released studio outtakes confirm that it was, in fact, Redding who did the whistling."

This time he couldn’t wait. He said, “Crop, I’ve got a hit. I’m coming right over.”\nWhen Otis walked in, he said, “Crop, get your gut-tar.” I always kept a Gibson B-29 around. He grabbed it, tuned it to an open E-chord, which made the guitar easier to play slide. Then Otis played and sang [this] verse he had written.\nI said, “Otis, hold on. If a ship rolls, it will take on water and sink.” He said, “That’s what I want, Crop.” So we let it go and worked on the rest of the song."

Kate is talking about how it’s just small and in the middle of nowhere, but she wants to go back regardless.\nAlso, since the Love Shack, as a place, was meant partially as a metaphor for some of the more energetic and fun venues that the B-52’s performed at, this is recognizing that they, at least in the beginning, were just a small band that was hard to notice, but once you did you loved them."

I’ve never heard that particular expression, and I don’t even know how it came up, but I hear it all the time now!”\n\nA 1990 Spin article offers some insight into how the line first worked its way into “Love Shack”:\n\nAt one point while they were jamming, Keith Strickland stopped playing. Cindy kept singing. She screamed, ’T-i-i-i-n roof!“ thinking the music was still going. Then she looked around and realized everything had stopped, and just said, \"Rusted.” The band worked it into “Love Shack”’s final mix."

The song was originally written by the husband and wife hit songwriting duo of Nickolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson. Nick Ashford came from Willow Run in 1964 with a dream of making it in NY. Before he got to that dream he spent months in Bryant park–homeless. The lyrics, “Ain’t no mountain high, Ain’t no valley low, Ain’t no river wide enough, baby,”  symbolizes how Ashford felt about his troubles. “Simpson recalls how he said he was walking by the large buildings in the district of Central Park West and thought, ‘The buildings looked like mountains.” Ashford was determined to make it and not let his obstacles deter him."

Producer/Songwriter Brian Wilson removed “we find” so that the bassline leading to the “Good Vibrations” hook is heard more prominently, thought nowadays sometimes singer Mike Love adds the line back during live perfomances.\n\nNote:\nBrian Wilson was known for his use of LSD and other drugs, which was fitting as “Good Vibrations” became a cornerstone of psychedelic music.\n\nAt a modern glance we may see them as psychedelic pioneers; but in the sixties they were seen as all-American boys with a clean-cut look."

Hitchcock films tend to focus on people’s descent into madness, and thus fit well with the rest of the song.\n\n“I want your horror,” in a metaphorical sense, refers to these Hitchcock “horror films.” Furthermore, in light of discovering these dark secrets that her lover harbors, she accepts him for all he is, seeing him as some kind of bad boy “criminal”.\n\n“I want your psycho” implies that Gaga craves her lover’s wild side. In addition, she wishes for her lover to behave like the characters from the movie Vertigo to fulfill her power fantasy. After all, in the film, the lead female Judy (played by Kim Novak) manipulates the lead male John Fergurson (played by James Stewart). Lastly, “want you in my rear window” implies a desire for anal sex, as Gaga desires pleasure from her “rear”.\n\n\n\nAlthough the official lyric is “shtick”, Gaga makes no qualms in pronouncing it a bit more like “stick”. Thus, her lover’s “vertigo stick” is also referring to his genitalia. This could also be a reference to her earlier-released song “Lovegame” where the speaker expresses a desire to “take a ride on” her lover’s “disco stick.”"

Harrison shared that when he first played the song for his friends, they weren’t immediately convinced of the sound:\n\nI remember when I first did the beat, I played it for a lot of my buddies, as I normally do, and they couldn’t dig it. But that’s when I knew I had something special. Sometimes people need to hear the whole record.\n\nIn that same interview with MTV, he admits that even Beyoncé had reservations about the song, since she believed it was “too retro” and that “no one used horn riffs, in the 21st century”.\n\nFrom her face, she was kind of like, ‘I don’t know, but I'mma ride with you anyway’. I knew I was going to have to sell it a little bit, because when it comes on it doesn’t sound like anything that was being done at the time.\n\nAnyway, Harrison managed to convince her that this was the right one, and the end result was a sample that went on to become one of the most iconic in pop music."

André is thanking his forebears for showing him that a successful long-term relationship can work and providing the knowledge on how to make it work.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with The Huffington Post, André 3000 revealed that “Thank God for Mom and Dad” was a possible early title for what became “Hey Ya!”:\n\nThe song went through several working titles, that was one of them.

Usually the woman is standing with her back to the man, so she can grind on him with her behind. See the picture.\n\nBumping and grinding can be done to various types of music, to different emotional effects. Bumping and grinding to slow jam music would usually be very sensual, like R Kelly’s Bump N Grind suggests.\n\nSlow Jams are usually slow RnB or Soul songs, often focused on love making.\n\nExamples:\n\nBump n' Grind by R Kelly\nLet’s Get It On by Marvin Gaye\nSexual Healing by Marvin Gaye\nThe Lady In My Life by Michael Jackson\nIf Ever You’re In My Arms Again by Peabo Bryson\n\nSo Pac might be saying that he is getting it on with ladies.

I’d probably be more coy about it, I guess, just like, ‘call me, maybe? If you want to?'\n\nAdditionally, this chorus was deemed the most famous chorus of the 21st century by Billboard.\n\nInterestingly, according to Jepsen, these lines were almost not written into the chorus:\n\nWe had a verse, we had a completely different chorus, and I thought that what I was singing at the time – ‘Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy’ – was just, like, filler lyrics. I mentioned to [co-writer] Tavish [Crowe] that we would fix them later, and he said, ‘No, I think they’re kind of quirky and light-hearted and fun. I think we should keep those.'\n\nAccording to Jepsen, the next day the two took the song to Josh Ramsay, the leader of Marianas Trench, who suggested that they turn the song’s pre-chorus into its proper chorus.

In a 1996 interview in Thailand, MJ said:\n\nThey would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers.\n\nJ. Randy Taraborrelli, the author of MJ’s biography The Magic & The Madness, wrote that the Billie Jean character was derived from a young woman who alleged MJ was the father of her child. While this is possible, MJ shrugged the claim in his autobiography Moonwalk:\n\nThere never was a real Billie Jean. The girl in the song is a composite of people my brothers have been plagued with over the years. I could never understand how these girls could say they were carrying someone’s child when it wasn’t true.\n\nAs a single that sold exceptionally well upon release, on the best selling album of all time, this is one of the most famous choruses in existence."

People try to stereotype us.\n\nIn the same interview, manager Russel Simmons added:\n\nThe guys sing about staying in school, going to church, respecting your mother, don’t take drugs.\n\nBut years later, DMC admitted:\n\nYeah we was getting high as hell. I was a cocaine man, Run was a weed head, and Jay was weed and 40s. The coke in the ‘80s was the best coke ever!"

Swift says “that face” rather than “your face” – while this is a common turn of phrase, and not out of place, it also subtly disconnects her attraction from the person she’s singing about.

Swift uses the word “boy” purposefully to allude to a lack of maturity by her former partners.\n\nUnlike in past songs about bad boys breaking her heart, such as “I Knew You Were Trouble”, she’s the bad girl that will break his.\n\nSwift explained this lyric to The Sun:\n\nI was thinking about this. Boys only want love if it’s torture and a constant chase. Men want love if it’s real, right, healthy and consistent."

She is illustrating herself in the way the media often does.\n\nIn this case, she is portrayed to be someone who lures men in with her good looks but once they enter into a relationship with her she becomes crazy and obsessive – and it is like a nightmare rather than what her current significant other might have perceived her to be.\n\n\n\nAlso, of course, nightmare is recurring and terrible whereas a daydream is usually short and pleasant. Their love might seem short and pleasant, but realistically? It’s going to come back and haunt you."

She states that although she may seem pretty on the outside, like a rose garden, she is actually very dangerous and you will get hurt if you mess with her. She illustrates that the relationship will be a messy one, and her lover should be prepared for that. She may come off as naive, but internally she is a dominant female.\n\nSwift very clearly states that she is capable of many things. So, in many cases, this would be the perfect storm of “crying” (rain) and “screaming” (thunder). This isn’t the only time Taylor discusses “perfect storms” on 1989 — she does the same on “Clean,” the last track of the album’s standard edition.\n\nShe illustrates the imagery into your head:  she is a psychotic girlfriend.\n\nThe imagery of a rose garden is reminiscent of a panel from her music video for “Our Song.”"

Miley swinging on this wrecking ball would exert approximately 198,000 newtons—in other words, Miley’s wrecking ball could push a wall (or Hemsworth) with as much force as a 747 engine. A wrecking ball like the one in the video is about 1000 pounds while Miley is around 105 pounds.\n\nShe threw herself into the relationship like a wrecking ball. She wanted it so bad. She felt like she needed it. It was different from her other relationships. And why she came in so hard, she thought she would be able to understand him more and he would be himself and let her in his life. She didn’t hold back her feelings, and in the end, both (specially her) were destroyed as if hit by demolition equipment."

I was just like “Yo, that section, right there, I gotta make a beat out of that.” I recorded the demo version of it the same day I made the beat. I didn’t like the rhyme, and put it off to the side.\n\nBut it’s one of those beats I never gave up on. That beat was definitely a highlight of my producing. I ended up doing the new version on the set of the movie, just writing between takes.\n\n8 Mile wasn’t coming out for another year and a half, and Curtis really wanted music for the movie. He wanted it to be created from the environment, so he was pushing me to make stuff. I think “Lose Yourself” was the only thing I worked on specifically for the movie.\n\nWe filmed half of it in the dead of winter. We had a music trailer on set, designed like a studio. One trailer was music, and we had another with gym equipment in it.\n\nWe were on lunch break, and I needed to finish the track. I don’t think it was one take all the way down, but it was one take each verse. “Got the first verse, okay, punch me in at the second. OK, the whole third verse.” For some reason, I just captured something there that I didn’t want to change. I remember trying to change it and go back and re-do the vocals, and I was like “Yo, let me listen to the old ones? Just keep the old ones, fuck it.”"

They went dressed in white suits, ribbons hanging from their hats, flowers clutched in their hands. The crowd favoured the brave and cocky (as discussed in chapter 2 of The Fatal Shore).\n\nWhat does that say about Kesha, especially in light of the sexual and emotional abuse she suffered on her rise to stardom?

The Beastie Boys ushered in a certain level of acceptance/appropriation of white people in rap/hip-hop music and culture. Ke$ha’s sing/talk style and flow may be taken as an attempt to enter into the rap scene as a white female, and the parallel with the Beastie Boys helps situate Ke$ha’s relationship with the music she’s putting out."

                        "plain": "The literal meaning is straight-forward: Ke$ha puts on her glasses (probably sunglasses) to get ready to party around the city.\n\nOn a metaphorical level, the speaker is clearly impaired and intoxicated as evidenced by her diminished sense of self perception. “Grab my glasses,” in this case, is the natural reaction—her vision is blurred, and she’s dizzy. Despite the fact that these are, quite clearly, the effects of alcohol overindulgence, she attempts to correct her problem with an external tool. She tries to treat the symptoms, hoping the glasses will adjust her debilitated vision, but never addresses the real issue, her inebriation.\n\nTaking alcohol to be a symbolism for an abusive relationship, it becomes easy to understand what the lyric self is going through. This negative relationship has had a such a strong grip on her for such a long time that, even after being rested, she still feels out of place as soon as she wakes up in the morning—she’s no longer who she used to be. She understands the suffering because it is being experienced on a personal level, but perhaps in fear to blame her abusive relationship for her perilous predicament, she seeks out temporary and external remedies, symbolized by the glasses, in order to palliate her impairment. It is even possible that the same glasses, futile in the correction of her folly, serve as mask that conceals the abuse she has experienced.\n\nAs the lyrics continue, the profile of the speaker as a victim of abuse becomes even clearer. After she grabs her glasses, she’s “out the door, I’m gonna hit this city.” On the literal level, this is a young woman who, as we find out later on in the song, is destitute (“ain’t got no money in my pocket”) and non-influential in her community. Claiming to hit the city, in its entirety, is a hyperbole that evokes a stark contrast between who she claims to be and who she really is.\n\nThis dichotomy, which from the very beginning is a leitmotif, leads the audience to ponder the deeper meaning behind the song. The upbeat rhythm coupled with the “I’m on top of the world” words is nothing but an inflated sense of confidence that serves as a disguise for the unbearably painful environment of abuse in which the speaker currently resides. Though she may look and act like she is about to “hit this city,” this boastful attitude is nothing but an attempt to make up for the sense of belonging she lacks."

                        "plain": "The song starts with the iconic statement where the speaker declares she “wake[s] up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy,” a famous rapper.\n\nKe$ha, the author of the lyrics, takes pride in her country roots that have taught her how to tell a story through music, but the reason for placing this phrase as the opening of the song goes beyond mere chronological order. Much like George Orwell’s “all the clocks were striking thirteen” in 1984, the comparison between the speaker, a woman, and a rich black man is striking enough to set the tone for the rest of the song. This same tone of irony that makes everything seem out of place is what drives the underlying theme of the song, the duality of what is felt and what is expressed. The speaker is hung over from a night of late partying and wakes up confused, hazed, and feeling like a rap mogul instead of feeling like her true self. (and given her possibly hungover status, she’s even puffy, Diddy’s nickname)\n\nIn an interview to Esquire, Ke$ha explains the literal, non-metaphorical meaning of her first line:\n\nOne morning I just woke up, and I live in this house with I-don’t-even-know-how-many roommates – it’s this Laurel Canyon house with seven rooms and roommates fluctuating monthly […] Well it was the house The Eagles recorded Hotel California in. So it’s just this huge hippy… There are a bunch of hippies who come in and out, and there are all these people sleeping on the couches. I don’t really care, I don’t mind it. But I woke up one day after we went to a party, and I was surrounded by ten of the most beautiful women you’ve ever seen. And I was like, I’m like P. Diddy – there’s no man like this in the entire world. So that became the first line of the new single, and we just went from there.\n\n\n\nAs is explained in the refrain, this song, as a whole, is a nod to the Beastie Boys' “Fight For Your Right.” The first line of TiK ToK alludes to [the first line in the Beastie Boys' song, “You wake up late for school”. That, in turn, follows a longer-standing tradition of starting lines. Some Blues songs start with the phrase “I woke up this morning” before listing a list of woes/tragedies in a godless, abandoned world. This traces back further to the starting statement “The Lord woke me up this morning” that is recurrent in black gospel music. The book Woke Me Up This Morning: Black Gospel Singers and the Gospel Life explains this trope at length.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that both Ke$ha and the Beastie Boys allude to this phrase, along with their own take on it. As they, white artists, are entering a black-dominated music genre (namely rap/hip-hop), having this connection establishes their recognition of hip-hop roots and acknowledges the rich tradition that precedes them.\n\nDuring a performance at Coachella 2024, Ke$ha changed this opening lyric:\n\nWake up in the morning like, “f*** P. Diddy”\n\nThis change was in a response to Diddy’s physical violence, sexual abuse, and sex trafficking charges, after his two houses were raided by law enforcement, for the foretold matter."

So I had him stand off-mic and sing along with the track as we cut the track to make sure that the tempo was right and that the breaks were right and all that kind of stuff. And then later on we brought him and we had a two-track machine and we dubbed him in. There’s a break and then, you know, the band goes silent, and he comes in, `Ba-la-ba-la, la bamba.‘ And right there he comes in just a little bit early on the off mic. So we didn’t wipe it because we figured well nobody’s gonna be playing this record anyway. So we didn’t clean it up.”"

The singer indicates this will be him, since he has been instructing his partner on how to properly do the dance.\n\nAlternatively, if the dance in question does not require one partner to literally lead the dance, it could be meant more symbolic.

In the Caribbean, “bamba” is a term for people of African descent; in Central America, “bamba” can mean a silver coin. However, the most likely use in this case comes from Mexico – Valens' parents were Mexican – where “bamba” is a term for dance.\n\nIn short, a literal English translation would make the song titled “The Dance”, and – in a slight break from Checkers' Twist, which gives literal instructions on how to do the Twist – the lyrics to La Bamba impart the qualities one must possess in order to do the titular dance properly."

                        "plain": "The chorus of “bad guy” is unique for a pop hit as it is almost entirely instrumental, based on a repeating synth melody. In a video for Rolling Stone, Eilish revealed that the melody was inspired by several musical themes from her childhood: the theme song from the Disney Channel show Wizards of Waverly Place, as well as the theme from the video game Plants vs. Zombies. Fans have also noticed similarities to the melody of the song “We Are Number One” from the children’s television series LazyTown, which became an internet meme in 2016.\n\nCoincidentally, Eilish’s brother FINNEAS has produced for Selena Gomez, who starred in Wizards of Waverly Place and sang its theme song. Gomez was made aware of the theme song’s inspiration on “bad guy” during an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2020, in which Jimmy Fallon played both songs side-by-side:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7TCzxOS6H4&t=3m25s\n\nFellow Wizards co-stars Jennifer Stone and David DeLuise also acknowledged “bad guy” in the first episode of the Wizards of Waverly Pod podcast series in 2023. DeLuise revealed that he too has a connection to Eilish as his cousin is friends with her parents, and he met her when she was much younger."

I think Nicki Minaj said in one of her songs that she’s the bad guy, and I didn’t realize that until recently….It’s such a cool juxtaposition of that sentence. Why do people resonate with it? I know why I resonate with it, but they’re all my own reasons.\n\nThe Nicki Minaj song that Billie refers to is “Chun-Li,” where Minaj raps:\n\nOh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy\nWell it’s the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me\n\nBoth Eilish and Minaj’s “bad guy” lines reference a scene in the 1983 movie, Scarface, where Tony Montana complains:\n\nMe, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie. So say good night to the bad guy! Come on. The last time you gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. Come on. Make way for the bad guy. There’s a bad guy comin' through! Better get outta his way!\n\nBillie further explained the idea behind the line in a July 2019 KIIS FM interview:\n\nIt’s basically making fun of everyone and their personas of themselves…. In general, I feel like you will never catch a bad bitch telling everyone she’s a bad bitch…. If you’re going around all the time saying, like, ‘Yeah, I’m bad, I’m always breaking rules and doing this and doing that.’ You’re not. I know that because I used to say that and I wasn’t. Bad kids, bad boys, bad bitches, whatever, they do that shit and they don’t even know."

Her description of him ties into the image of the “bad boy” that any sane father would disapprove of. This doesn’t frighten her, however; instead, she counters by telling him how similar they are.\n\nBillie would later explain in a video for Rolling Stone that these lyrics are sarcastic – if this man can lie about his characteristics and be “fake”, she can certainly do the same.\n\nBillie describing herself as the “might seduce your dad type” garnered some minor controversy due to the singer only being 17 at the time of the song’s release. The line is intentionally questionable, however, and serves to drive the point home. This “bad guy” character that Billie is pretending to be seems to be boastful and proud of their actions (“I’m only good at bein' bad”), and they threaten to go to extremes without caring about the emotional destruction they may cause in the process."

Billie Eilish has often talked about how colors are very expressive to her, and she loves to tie visuals to her songs in music videos. It makes sense then, that she would use the imagery of a white shirt, pure and untainted, now corrupted by blood, symbolizing pain as a metaphor for the loss of innocence."

Part of the City tour, right. I was on that tour and I believe Jay caught me in one of those cities and he was like, ‘Yo, I need you to go in with my girl.’ I’m like, alright, cool. Literally, when the buck stopped here, we went to rock the mic and there’s everybody and this is a true story. Everybody is ready to work, Stargate is in one room, there’s a couple of other producers in one of the side rooms, Timbaland is in the back and I walk in. The thing that people mostly don’t know about me is I talk shit to literally rev myself up to do it. It’s not that I may believe it, it’s the crazy part of why did you put yourself in that scenario, now you’ve got to come up with some shit.\n\nI walk into the studio and I’m just loud and obnoxious and being silly and I said, ‘I don’t know who has or think they have the first single on B but it’s over with, I got the first single.’ I had not wrote a record, I didn’t know what I was going to write. I ain’t heard a beat, nothing. I literally backed myself into this corner. That wasn’t the first record I wrote that night. There was another record, it was really, really good, it just wasn’t “Single Ladies,” which was the next record I wrote, which it took probably approximately around 17 minutes to do. Usually those songs that take a small amount of time are usually the bigger ones because you’re not thinking about it, it’s just a mood. I had no idea had already been calculating what I felt like Beyoncé should say to everybody if you were Beyoncé, which is kind of everybody. If you’re not married, you’re in a relationship with some guy that just happens to be Jay Z.\n\nYou’re in a relationship with a guy, you want him to commit. How do I make this a coffee table conversation that the guys of course are going to lynch me for, of course, but all the women are going to love it and that’s who I love so I don’t really care. I come up with this brilliant idea, “If you like it, then you should’ve put a ring on it.” I’m like, yeah that sounds like some sassy shit a girl would say to me. Well, now I’m gone so you should’ve seen some at first, bye."

So, the hook was good. “If you like it, then you should have put a ring on it.” I knew every girl would say, “That’s me! That’s me and my ex-boyfriend!” You know what’s up. But once I got the bridge, I thought the song could become iconic. Without the bridge, it would just be this melodic hip-hop record. I believe that’s why it got Song of the Year.\n\nThere was no discussion of the lyrics. Me and B at that time wasn’t like the me and B of now, where we could have that discussion. At that point it was like “Hey, I’m B, this god of a songstress, and you’re a writer who is just now getting here.”"

We got to the studio and were going to work on Beyoncé’s stuff. We were at Roc The Mic Studios. I walk in and there were producers to my left, and on the backside. I remember saying “Oh, I’ve got the first single. I don’t know why all of you are working so hard!” I hadn’t written shit. I didn’t know what I was going to write. “Single Ladies” wasn’t the first song we did.\n\nWe did something first, just getting oiled up. We weren’t in our home studio, it was a foreign studio. So the second track Tricky pulls up is “Single Ladies” — he’s done the beat but that’s all. In my head, I’ve conjured up what I want to talk about, in terms of subject matter, but I don’t have any melodies. I was doing this thing that now I see Jay do, sitting there and compartmentalizing. I could tell Trick was looking at me, trying to figure out what I’m doing. He said, “OK, OK, let’s start on another one.” I said, “Oh hell no, we’re going to do this shit right here.” He said “Alright, I’ll step out for a second.” I walk in the booth, and it may have taken two takes to get “Single Ladies.” Started out with “all the single ladies,” just like the song goes.\n\nAfter two takes, about 75% of the song is done. I knew that talking about B’s life and what you probably understood of it, with her and Jay being married or not being married, would strike a chord with people, because everybody wanted to know what was going on."

He is pretending like him misbehaving is a behavior that can only be corrected by something painful, like getting whipped. However, the highly sexual song clearly is pretending like getting whipped is undesirable; he sees it as positive reinforcement. In the words of Edward Thorndike and BF Skinner, behaviors with favorable consequences will occur more frequently and behaviors followed by less favorable consequences will occur less frequently\"."

Pepper album cover has the 4 Beatles dressed in psychedelic versions of military uniforms, and begins with a somewhat mocking musical reference to military marches (plus, military bands are mostly composed of soldiers with the rank of Sergeant). The album jokes that the Beatles were taking over yet another genre. For a few years, the Beatles top the charts with successive albums, refusing to yield to other musical players, as adults and politicians bemoan the lack of interest of young people in more traditional genres of music."

[She] got a streak of calling me every night before bed, and I missed it once, and she wanted to let me know that she was quite angry with me.\n\nA potential interpretation of this interjection, following the album’s promotional motif of doors, is that Ruby is speaking to Harry from the other side of a closed door as he refuses to let anyone into his house. This metaphor relates to the theme of struggling with honesty and vulnerability that is prevalent through Styles’s discography.

We’ve been here before\nIt’s just what we know\n\nHarry’s debut album’s opening track, “Meet Me in the Hallway,” also expresses similar feelings:\n\nWe don’t talk about it, it’s something we don’t do\n‘Cause once you go without it, nothing else will do\n\nCarrying emotions and oppressing them because of the pain they could cause when opening up about them, seems to be a habit. This attitude towards emotions can lead to the recurrence of these harmful feelings. Consequently, it can also cause a sudden explosion of emotion within the person, which may destroy valuable things in their life.\n\nThis cycle was also represented on the song’s music video, where Styles and his partner can be seen running in a circle:"

Styles finds himself alone and outside his lover’s bedroom, crawling for their comeback “on the floor,” “at the door.”\n\nThere’s also an interpretation that suggests those lyrics are taken from a possible conversation between Styles and his sister, Gemma, after their parents' divorce.\n\nThe pills mentioned in this verse are also reminiscent of the opening lines from “Meet Me In The Hallway:”\n\nMeet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway\nI just left your bedroom, give me some morphine\nIs there any more to do?\n\nStyles also writes about his self-destructive behaviours on tracks such as April 2017’s “Ever Since New York,” as well as December 2019’s “To Be So Lonely.”"

A force to, like, face things head-on, whether that is your least favourite things about the world, or your least favourite things about yourself, all of those things, you just can’t then pretend that stuff doesn’t exist.\n\nThis line reflects on how the passage of time affects on many things and changes its essence. On one side, maybe because of a breakup, a hypothetical couple has been affected by some circumstances that changed them and their ways of acting with each other.\n\nOn the other hand, Styles could be talking to himself, contemplating how time and the experiences he faced have modified him.\n\nIn both cases, Harry seems to have gone through situations like this one, as he wrote in a similar way in the 2017 track, “Two Ghosts.” His debut album song reflects on the major character developments of two people after some time:\n\nWe’re not who we used to be"

Here, his love, being like a shadow cast on her, places her in the titular total eclipse.  For the other theme, Vampires famously cast no shadow, which makes the fact that his love is like a shadow on her proof to her that his love is tangible in a way even his body is not.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/eclipse/Solar-eclipse-phenomena"

A free fall might end in a splat.\n\nAnd the magic of this line is that the relation between “free” and “free fallin'” is vague. The relation can be either the contrast between positive and negative, or it can have no contrast in the sense that it is all positive. It is about asking yourself the question whether the obtained (absolute) freedom is something good or bad (for you); it’s about questioning who you are and who you want to be; it’s about identity."

DeNiro is one of the co-founders, and the public face, of the annual Tribeca Film Festival, as well as one of the co-founders of The Tribeca Grill and the production company TriBeCa Productions.\n\nBack in 2012, DeNiro and Jay shared a few unpleasant words (mostly on DeNiro’s part) after he repeatedly failed to call the movie star back, and never delivered on a promise to record a song for the Tribeca Film Festival. DeNiro called him “rude [and] disrespectful,” with Hov replying that the veteran actor hadn’t shown him enough respect:\n\nIt doesn’t matter who you are, everybody has to be respectful and everybody has to be a human being, you know? No one’s above manners … We’re all human beings and we all have to be respectful to one another and that’s just standard. That’s how I carry on with anybody.\n\nIn February 2016 they re-united publically at the amFAR Gala, signalling their issues had been resolved.\n\n\n\nDeNiro also sounds like “dinero,” the Spanish word for money. In his previous career as a drug dealer Hov would follow the money across the city; and later his success in the rap game meant he was able to pay $6.85 million for his penthouse."

It was just supposed to get me thinking…\n\nWhile Rob [Hyman] played, I stood next to the piano and danced, kind of free form. Moving around like that to the music helped me figure out how the song should feel. I wanted to catch a vibe off what Rob was doing.\n\nRob had just the chorus—a good melody but no words. As I danced to what Rob played I started thinking about up and down, lost and found: “If you fall I will catch you, I will be waiting / Time after time” and “If you’re lost you can look and you will find me / Time after time.” It sounded odd at first, but when I sang it, I realized what I was talking about. They were pieces of my personal life.\n\n\nAt the time, Rob Hyman was coming off of a breakup while Lauper was having her own issues with her then-boyfriend/manager Dave Wolff."

As Verónica Bayetti Flores, an outspoken feminist, wrote: “we all know who she’s thinking when we’re talking gold teeth, Cristal and Maybachs.” Rap Stats can confirm that Maybach cars, Cristal champagne, and diamonds are all hip-hop staples:\n\n\n\nUltimately, while some felt Lorde could have been more mindful considering the negative stereotypes hip-hop videos can create for African-Americans, most journalists (especially international journalists) disagreed with Flores. In a post titled “Intercultural Competence”, Martin Boyd dismissed Flores argument as ethnocentric, reminding Flores that Lorde is from New Zealand. Since Lorde derives her entire understanding of America through these music videos, it isn’t a generalization for her to say that every American she sees is participating in these activities. Another New Zealand journalist, Lynda Brendich, echoed that “not everything in this world should be viewed through the lens of Americans, particularly when it comes to race and cultures of other countries.”\n\nLorde declined to comment on the controversy."

Cadillac has been building powerful luxury cars for American figures such as Al Capone, Elvis Presley, President Obama, and Big Boi, since before WWII.\n\nLorde re-used the line as a tag for her Tumblr."

After she grabbed the media spotlight, Lorde told The Guardian that, while growing up, her favourite author was Raymond Carver. It’s no surprise that she liked the famous realist author: one of his re-occuring themes is the “extraordinary in the ordinary\". Lorde’s success, in a way, could be seen as Carveresque, she championed “the ordinary” and it made her famous."

The “buzz” can refer to the excitement that comes with a life full of “luxe”, but is also the sound the bee makes; the pun also calls back to Lorde’s self-proclaimed title: Queen Bee."

Several years later, in January of 1994, Kurt Cobain would famously admit to Rolling Stone that he was just “trying to write the ultimate pop song.”\n\nHis signature use of sarcasm and nihilistic wordplay throughout Nirvana’s catalog makes it easy to write these cryptic lines off as meaningless; however, different iterations of Cobain’s hand-written lyrics depict a much darker inception.\n\n\n\nThis scan is taken from page 141 of Kurt Cobain’s Journals, published in November 2002—just eight years after his alleged suicide in April 1994 at the age of 27. According to the LiveNirvana song guide, the original words were:\n\nThe secret handshakes pretend\nOur little group has always been and always will until the end\nWe cut our hands & made a pact & swore we’re never going back"

The repetition of “hello” sounds rather simple; even dumb or silly. A slight change in pronunciation becomes a typical, depression-oriented Nirvana line, with “how low” likely being a commentary on Kurt’s mood.\n\n\n\nAn alternative interpretation points out that “hello” becomes “hollow,” just like the average artist’s method for lyric-writing relies on basic repetitions, or catchiness over meaning."

Kurt’s alleged suicide note—which has been transcribed—includes the following statement:\n\nI haven’t felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things.\n\nIt can also extend beyond his feelings on music, and into life. Two of his uncles committed suicide, and Kurt suffered from bipolar disorder. He had frequent mood swings, causing him to feel conflicting emotions toward fame, drug use, the music industry, and his own identity."

He was an extremely humble and self-deprecating individual, coming to loathe his fame and hating the image that the media portrayed of him. It is ironic that in the song that propelled him to stardom he alludes to his disgust with himself.\n\nThis also has a tie to his suicide note where he feels that his daughter Frances B. Cobain would grow up to be like him, his worst fear. He says to Boddah (His imaginary friend) that she,\n\nReminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can’t stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I’ve become.\"\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Cobain explained the “Here we are now, entertain us” line saying:\n\nThat came from something I used to say every time I used to walk into a party to break the ice. A lot of times, when you’re standing around with people in a room, it’s really boring and uncomfortable. So it was “Well, here we are, entertain us. You invited us here.”\n\nIn this setting, Kurt uses the line to mock his fans' attitude. “Teen Spirit” ends up being a bunch of teenage fans that expect to be entertained. Kurt feels the pressure of this demand, and he is cynical about the selfish desires that underlie fandom.\n\nJustin Timberlake would later pay homage to this lyric in his collaboration with rapper JAY-Z, Holy Grail, the opening track off of the latter’s thirteenth album.\n\nAnd we all just entertainers\nAnd we’re stupid and contagious\nAnd we all just entertainers"

More acceptable classifications would be “mixed” or “biracial.” Albinism, from the Latin word albus, meaning “white,” is a genetic condition which results in melanin deficiency; the complex polymer responsible for pigmentation in skin.\n\nBoth of these terms can be seen as opposites, even though people of mixed race have the same chances of being born with albinism. Due to the inherent differences from the Western “norm,” these separate groups of people may feel “left out” in society. This could be one of the reasons why Kurt Cobain mentioned them—because he could relate to not fitting in.\n\nInterestingly, a “Mulatto,” an “Albino,” and a “Mosquito” are all different types of old-fashioned cocktails.

                        "plain": "“Sponge cake” has become a popular phrase due to the famous line from the iconic song “Margaritaville” by Jimmy Buffett: “Nibblin' on sponge cake.” While seemingly lighthearted and casual, this line holds a deeper meaning beyond its surface level.\n\nSponge cake is a soft, light, and airy dessert that has been enjoyed by people around the world for centuries. Its origins can be traced back to the Mediterranean region, particularly to Italy and Spain. The cake gets its unique texture and sponginess from a careful balance of ingredients, including flour, sugar, eggs, and sometimes butter or oil. It is leavened mainly by beaten eggs, resulting in its distinct airy texture.\n\nMetaphorically, the act of “nibbling on sponge cake” in the song represents a carefree and indulgent mindset, highlighting the joys of simple pleasures. It symbolizes finding contentment and bliss in life’s small and humble moments. It encourages us to appreciate the sweetness of life, even in the smallest moments, by savoring the metaphorical sponge cake.\n\nBy associating sponge cake with a relaxed and carefree attitude, the song reminds us to shift our focus from the pressures and complexities of life and find joy in the present moment. It encourages us to adopt a mindset that allows us to take a step back, breathe, and enjoy the delightful simplicity that life can offer.\n\nSo, when contemplating the phrase “nibblin' on sponge cake,” let it serve as a reminder to relish the simple pleasures, find contentment in the present, and embrace a carefree mindset that allows us to savor life’s sweetest moments."

As a kid, I’d always been fascinated by Africa. I loved movies about Dr. Livingstone and missionaries. I went to an all-boys Catholic school, and a lot of the teachers had done missionary work in Africa.

you're hundred and one years old\nI don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast\nBut we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast\nWe rock it up, a baby bubba\nBaby bubba to the boogie, the bang-bang, the boogie\nTo the beat, beat, it's so unique\nCome on, everybody, and dance to the beat\n\n\nA hip-hop, the hippie, the hippie\nTo the hip, hip-hop and you don't stop\nA rock it out, baby bubba, to the boogie, the bang-bang\nThe boogie to the boogie, the beat\n\nI say I can't wait 'til the end of the week\nWhen I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat\nAn attempt to raise your body heat\nA just blow your mind so a that you can't speak\nA do a thing, but a rock and shuffle your feet\nAnd let it change up to a dance called the freak\nAnd when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat\nRest a little while so ya don't get weak\nI know a man named Hank\nHe has more rhymes than a serious bank\nSo come on, Hank, a sing that song\nA to the rhythm of the boogie, the bang-bang, the bong\n\nWell, I'm Imp the Dimp, the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\nAnd when you come inside, into the front\nYou do the freak, spank, and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MCs try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio, a with a serious joint\nA from sun to sun and from day to day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\nI'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist\nEverybody, I say it goes like this\nWell, I was coming home late one dark afternoon\nReporter stopped me for a interview\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter, I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said, \"Damn, fly guy, I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\"\nI said, \"By the way, baby, what's your name?\"\nSaid \"I go by the name Lois Lane\"\nAnd you could be my boyfriend, you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\nI said, \"He's a fairy, I do suppose\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\nI said, \"You need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light?\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\"\nI go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it\nAn' I'm here and I'm there, I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere\nA just throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it, a don't stop, y'all, a tick a tock, y'all, you don't stop\n\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a what you gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\n'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friend\n\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\nIt was twelve o'clock a one Friday night\nI was rocking to the beat and feeling alright\nEverybody was dancing on the floor\nDoing all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly, fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, its time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow, the group ya hear is called Phase 2\nAnd let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew\nOnce a week we're on the street\nJust a cutting the jams and making it freak\nFor you to party, got to have the moves\nSo we'll get right down and give you a groove\nFor you to dance you got to be hype\nSo we'll get right down and make ya rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rocking affair\nBut let me tell ya something, there's still one fact\nThat to have a party, got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over you're making it home\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while ya sleeping, you start to dream\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\nA name appears in your mind\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase 2 a just a doing the do\nRocking ya down 'cause ya know we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\nA come alive, girls, a get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat, to the beat, the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn and on until the break of dawn\nNow I got a man coming on right now\nHe's guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nA come on, Wonder Mike, do what ya like\n\nI say, a can of beer that's sweeter than honey\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike going up and not coming down\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat, beat, ya do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friend's house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good?\nI mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nA so you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says, \"Mama, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull\"\nA so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says, \"Man, there's plenty of food\"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nBut while the stinky food's steaming, your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh, so you say that's it, I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\nOh, so you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend a two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\nBaby bubba, but we're still friends\"\n\nA with a hip-hop, the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip, hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang-bang boogie, say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie, the beat\n\nI said, \"A Hank, a can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?\nA can ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\"\nI said, \"A come on, make, m-make the people move\"\n\nI go toot the horns and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\nI'm Big Bank, I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\nHe said, \"Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\nSo from '66 to this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style, finesse and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you've heard\nI didn't even bite, not a god**** word\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock, y'all, a beat-beat y'all\nA lets rock, y'all, ya don't stop\n\nIt go, \"Hotel, motel, a whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\n'Cause I'ma get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go, \"Hotel, motel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou see, if your girl starts acting up, then you take her friends\n\nA like that, y'all, a to the beat, y'all\nA beat-beat, y'all, ya don't stop\nA Master Gee, am I mellow?\nIt's on you, so whatcha gonna do?\n\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the late show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nA like the Bar-Kays singing \"Holy Ghost\"\nThe sounds I throw down, a they're played the most\nJust a like my man, a Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nA get off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got\nA to the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive girl, a get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Bar-Kays on the mic\nLike getting right down for you tonight\nLike moving your body so ya don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike coming alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two, I was doing the do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRocking to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGiving all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five, I didn't take no jive\n'Cause with the Master Gee, it's all the way live\nAt the age of six, I was a picking up sticks\nRapping to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rocking in heaven\nDon't ya know I went off?\nI gotta run on down to the beat, you see\nGetting right on down, making all the girls\nJust take off their clothes to the beat, the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight I was a really great\n'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\nAt the age of nine I was a right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nWe're going on and on, and on, on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA saying on and on, and on, on and on\nLike a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn\nA going on and on, and don't ya dare stop\nA rock-rock, y'all, a gimme what ya got\n'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nAnd I am the definite freak's delight\nI'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nI am the definite freak's delight\nThey call me the Master Gee, you see\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\n\nI'm gonna move ya here, I'm gonna move ya there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind\nI'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\nSaid, just rock it to the east and move it to the west\nMove it toward the lady you love-love the best\nMaster Gee, get it on\nTaggin' all the girls, goin' down\n(Gimme time, I'ma shock your mind)\n(A come and jig-jig-jigglin' your behind)",

                        "plain": "It’s true, Big Bank Hank did have a lot of rhymes. The problem was that they weren’t his own rhymes. Virtually all the rhymes he uses on “Rapper’s Delight” were originally written by his friend Grandmaster Caz. When Hank asked Caz if he could borrow some of the rhymes, Caz had no idea that Hank was going to use them for what would become the first hip-hop hit record.\n\nAt the time of recording, no one in the studio knew that what Hank rapped weren’t his own rhymes. Fellow crew member Master Gee, in an interview with JayQuan for The Foundation, remembered:\n\nWhen Hank started with “I’m the C-A-S-AN, the O-V-A, and the rest is F-L-Y,” we didn’t know, the sh*t sounded good! The funny thing about it was that he kept doing the same raps! We noticed in the beginning, even that first night, that he kept saying the same rhymes. We started saying, maybe that’s all he got. We went and recorded it, the record blew up, and we didn’t find out until a year later.\n\nIt was all he got. Later, when the Gang was working on new songs, it turned out that Hank wasn’t good at all at coming up with rhymes. In the same interview, Master Gee disclosed:\n\nBut what we noticed was when we went to do pre-production for all those songs – it was like, ok it’s writing time. I would write something, Mike would write something, we would ask each other what we thought about the rhymes. When we got to Hank he had his pad, but never had anything! This struck us as odd, and we were like “damn you said all that on \"Rapper’s Delight,” what happened?“ So we eventually found out, and what happened was he never wrote on anything. He gets no mechanical royalties on any of the songs because he never wrote anything."

Let me explain that to you.

She’s built like a brick shit house means that she’s strong, shit is not a negative thing, it just means that the brick shit house is not gonna fall down, it’s not a wooden house. I know that sounds bad (laughs).\n\nThere’s also the recollection from Commodore’s founder, guitarist, and trumpeter William King, who added that the term has a degree of fluidity and isn’t limited to a women with a particular physique. In a 2013 interview with AL.com, King shared:\n\n“Oh, it’s about any girl,” King says. “A girl that’s strong. The whole idea was a brick house is any guy’s imagination of his girl. Some guys like them tall, some guys like them short. Some guys like a little meat on the body, others like them slim. Some like them top-heavy, some like legs.

I remember that I wasn’t stumbling over those lyrics, I sang it all out as I wrote it, as it came to my head. We didn’t realize it would be a hit, because it was a piano ballad, but we were excited, because it was perfect for the song and what I was saying in the verses. There’s two choruses at the end, on the first chorus, I got really emotional. I had to sit on the floor in the booth, and I actually wanted to redo that chorus the next day, but Dan loved it, and he said it’s full of emotion, so we kept it. But there’s so much grace and forgiveness in these lyrics, which was very important for me in that relationship that 21 is about. I guess what inspired this lyric was similar to what I said earlier, about how you can go from loving someone to really hating them and despising them. I never felt like that, really, I know it probably seems like I did with that 21 album, but actually it wasn’t, I had the best time for a couple of years and I was really grateful that we’d come into each other’s lives, and I was just sad that we couldn’t really be friends anymore, ‘cause that was why we were together, it was because we got on so well. I could definitely write a lyric like this at this point in my life [2022] of being more mature and things like that if anything weren’t to last, so I relate to it.\n\nAdele’s ex (who she has still declined to name) says love sometimes lasts and sometimes it hurts instead. Evidently, this is one of those hurt relationships. According to the bridge, it’s bittersweet––the love and pain are both there.\n\nShe bitterly repeats his line at the end of the chorus, as if she’s reflecting on her (hurt) relationship with him. There’s hints of desperation in her “begging” to get back with her ex and hoping he’d see her face and want to get back together, but in the end, all she can do is reminisce about it and find someone like him to make new memories with. Maybe this song is a remedy for getting over him?"

In the 2006 book Recording the Beatles, engineer Malcolm Toft explained:\n\nBarry Sheffield engineered ‘Hey Jude,’ but I mixed it. John Lennon says a very rude word about halfway through the song. At 2:59 you will hear a ‘Whoa!’ from him in the background. About two seconds later you will hear, ‘Fucking hell!’ This was because when he was doing a vocal backing, Barry sent him the foldback level too loud and he threw the cans on the ground and uttered the expletive. But, because it had been bounced down with the main vocal, it could not be removed.\n\nAnother theory has it that the expletive is due to Lennon getting the previous lyric wrong and singing “let her into your skin” while doing the backing vocals under McCartney’s “let her under your skin.” On the other hand, tape operator John Smith recalls the exclamation came from McCartney:\n\nPaul hit a clunker on the piano and said a naughty word, but I insisted we leave it in, buried just low enough so that it can barely be heard. Most people won’t ever spot it—but we’ll know it’s there.\n\nAccording to engineer Ken Scott:\n\nI was told about it at the time but could never hear it. But once I had it pointed out I can’t miss it now. I have a sneaking suspicion they knew all along, as it was a track that should have been pulled out in the mix. I would imagine it was one of those things that happened—it was a mistake, they listened to it and thought, ‘doesn’t matter, it’s fine.’"

In fact, it even has a code name, “the 50s progression” based on its heavy use in the early soul and rock music of the 1950s. The best example of this song’s influence comes from Ben E. King’s classic 1961 song, “Stand By Me.”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwZNL7QVJjE\n\nSo why two Grammy awards, millions of albums sold, nine million plays on the radio and the $2000 a day Sting receives in royalties?\n\nMusical genius\n\nSting leans over and says, ‘Go on, go in there, make it your own.’ …It’s a simple chord sequence and shouldn’t prove a problem… What are the criteria? It should sound like the Police—big, brutal barre chords won’t do, too vulgar; it has to be something that says Police but doesn’t get in the way of the vocals; it should exist as music in its own right, universal but with just a hint of irony, be recognized the world over… The track rolls and I play a sequence of intervals that makes it sound like the Police, root, fifth, second, third, up and down through each chord. It is clean, succinct, immediately identifiable… I play it straight through in one take. There is a brief silence, and then everyone in the control room stands up and cheers… With this lick I realize a dream that maybe I have cherished since first picking up the guitar as a teenager — to at least once in my life make something that would go around the world, create a lick that guitarists everywhere would play.\n- Andy Summers, One Train Later: A Memoir, pg. 323\n\n\n\nProduction genius\n\n\n\nHugh Padgham is the record producer behind Synchronicity and was called upon by the band after their previous success with 1981’s Ghost in the Machine. Padgham had previously worked with bands like Yes, XTC and Peter Gabriel and was not much of a referee to the squabbling musicians. Recording took place at AIR Monserrat, a recording studio built by George Martin and located in the Caribbean. It was known as a “recording getaway” because it was the best way to record an album outside the reach of the record company.\n\n\n\nThe band during the recording of Ghost in the Machine.\n\nIn that environment, many tricks were employed to give this song, and the rest of the album, its timeless sound. With Stewart Copeland’s drums, Padgham had him record hitting a tightly-wound snare drum with a Tama gong drum at the same time. Copeland explains the rather unorthodox way his sounds were recorded:\n\nThe big studio that George Martin built was at one end of the building, and I was upstairs in the old house in the dining room, all by myself with a television monitor connecting me to the studio downstairs across the way… The first thing you have to do when you record music is lay down a drum track, but we were making it up as we went along, and I wasn’t in the room with them. So, instead of finishing playing and going, ‘Hey, that was good there, and that went there,’ there is silence. I can’t hear what one of them is saying unless one of them presses the talk-back button. They aren’t pressing the talk-back button, but I can see that they are talking and I assume it’s bad. The drums sounded incredible because that was definitely the place to get the best sound out of the drums. Inarguably, the drums sounded brilliant in that room.\n-Stewart Copeland, mixonline.com\n\n\n\nFunny enough, a lot of press would harp on the idea that each member of the band would record in separate rooms, though mainly it was a circumstance of finding the best sounds for the recording."

That’s when a happy accident changed everything, according to Padgham:\n\n\n[Sting] was fiddling around on the piano, banging away on the same note, and I remember shouting to him on the talkback, ‘Yeah! That’s it! Just the one-note thing is great!’ I was always into one-note stuff, ever since we did a one-note guitar solo on an XTC song — I liked its hypnotic effect and thought it was really cool. So, suddenly, when I heard Sting playing that note, it was like ‘There it is! We’ve got it!’ And that was after he’d been fiddling around for hours, trying to find a part.\n\nListening to the song now, I really like the dynamics going into the middle eight — the big, explosive ‘shplang’ guitar chords and overdubbed toms that were played with mallets — and that was all about experimenting until we got the right sound. In fact, the song’s overall sound still stands up because it’s not full of gimmicks…"

This underlying feeling of love has resulted in Björn Skifs feeling “high”, either figuratively or physically:\n\n\nPhysically: The persona is legitimately feeling light headed or delirious that the love of his life feels the same as he does, very much similarly to getting high via explicit substances\nFiguratively: The allusion to feeling “high” may also refer to an angelic reference, meaning that the woman is so high, she is divine and relates much to angels in heaven, therefore representing the pedestal that the persona places this woman upon\n\n\n\nTherefore, he is “Hooked on a feeling”; presumably not love or happiness, but rather a feeling he himself cannot find the words to explain, as it is a multitude of other feelings, all morphed into a single compassionate devotion that resonates within the listener’s ears. The listener can relate to this theme, as they too have felt the sweet embrace of love for themselves, and found themselves speechless at conveying that exact same feeling."

Because the narrator does change, we can interpret her as able to integrate this thrilling experience as a memory, whereas it seems the partner can’t let go of the “fast car” and live in the monotony of the verses, in which s/he never does seem to find a job."

As the relationship fractures, however, this “nothing” becomes a base of strength: “I got no plans, I ain’t going nowhere” conveys rootedness. When you have a home and children, having “no plans” means you’re the one who stays and keeps what she has."

In this moment of intense sensory stimulation, it is easier for the speaker to live solely in the present and escape the tragic realities of her life at home. Only in this moment of lights, touch, speed, adrenaline, has the speaker been able to imagine a purposeful future outside of their reality.\n\nHowever, the use of the word “drunk” is telling, especially as we understand that the speaker’s father is an alcoholic. Although she is not inebriated, in this moment she feels the same impulsiveness, numbness, and instability a drunk person would. Where her father’s escapism lies at the bottom of a bottle, hers lies in the feeling of this moment.\n\n Not only is the car a means of physical escape, but it also represents the speaker’s addiction to the search for identity, purpose, and independence."

After her mother left her alcoholic and unemployed father, the speaker was forced to give up her dreams and her education to take care of him. She has sacrificed everything for her deadbeat father, and now she is living with the consequences of it.\n\nThis sheds some light on why the speaker is so desperate to escape, and why she keeps talking about the fast car, hoping that she can “fly away” from her current life, leaving the past behind her and finally pursuing a proper life for herself.\n\nThe phrasing of the first two lines may be a reference to “The Bottle” by Gil Scott-Heron"

Church organizations, remember offer various kinds of pastoral care and religiously guided emotional and life help support circles (Alcoholics Anonymous started in churches, as a well-known example). The focus [was on] on reassurance of divine love, reward for effort and praying.”"

At that point in her life, she was being taken advantage of by a lot of the industry cats and a song like ‘Real Love’ described her situation.\n\nOne day, she said with tears in her eyes, ‘I just want a real love in my life for once.’ We wrote four or five songs before “Real Love” came together for her.

We did it at our home studio. The other thing about ‘Real Love’ is that when it came time to use the song for the album, I told Puffy I wanted to go back in and reproduce it. I wanted to take the sample out and replay the drums. He said, ‘No, No, No!’ I told him I wasn’t going to give away my publishing to Milk and Giz when we can play our own drums. He said, ‘That’s what makes the record dope. That’s what makes it hip-hop. Are you crazy? Don’t change it.’ Of course, I was fighting the fight and he came to the studio physically prepared to fight all of our asses that day. My partner, Mark Morales ended up siding with him.\nSo, I walked out of the studio and told them don’t put my name on that bullshit. I’m thankful that they didn’t pay me any attention.\n\nMark Morales was a rapper who never wrote R&B lyrics. He was a member of the Fat Boys. Mark was sitting on the other side of the room with a pad of paper and a pen. He starts writing lyrics down and all of a sudden he approaches me saying that he wrote some lyrics down to the music I was working on. He said, ‘Don’t laugh.’ I told him I wasn’t going to laugh and he started singing the first four lines of ‘Real Love.’ It was almost like a rap and I told him it was hot. I put melodies behind it and a bridge. The bridge was borne out of the melodies. It came together really fast. The original recording of the song took place in my basement in Queens."

The most clear sign that this subliminal beef actually happened may be the “Wordplay” freestyle:\n\nRappers know that I’m the same, they don’t wanna step to this, they don’t wanna feel the pain,\nLike DMX (DMX VOICE): “what? you gon think that he’s gon step to this now? eurgh, yo, you don’t think you wanna fuck with this now\n\nIt is said that the beef was squashed when 50 Cent beefed with Ja Rule.

In it he sings:\n\nGirl, your memory won’t ever haunt me\nCause I don’t love you, and now if you’ll buy that\nI got some ocean front property in Arizona\n\nFrank’s usage of Arizona in the first verse can also be attributed to this song, and in a similar fashion he builds on it by mentioning a beach house in Idaho. Yet, neither of these states have an oceanfront.\n\nThis points out to wordplay on “lying” since he apparently isn’t telling the truth. It’s also pretty clear Frank doesn’t actually own a fighter jet, but he accurately compares an unrequited love to having a jet you can’t fly. The cover of the single has Frank sitting in a Go-Kart, which is a visualization of this line.\n\nHowever, the motive behind lying is unclear; he could be doing it sarcastically to assert the person he loves them, or it’s his way of wiggling out of a rejection."

                        "plain": "In his 2012 open letter, Frank Ocean revealed his first love was a man, which asserts the idea that this song is about a male partner:\n\n4 summers ago, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. He was too. We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, time would glide. Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. I’d hear his conversation and his silence.. until it was time to sleep. Sleep I would often share with him. By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love, it changed my life.\n\nFrank also revealed through the letter that his love seemed unrequited when he confessed his feelings, which he acknowledges here. The entire song seems to take place in a conversation between them after his confession, or perhaps a conversation that Frank desperately wants to have with him but can only initiate in his mind—a conversation in which Frank’s first love seems to deny and diminish Frank’s feelings towards him, with Frank responding sarcastically to assert his love for him. Frank emphasizes that he still remembers his first love can never love him the way he wants, likely in response to him reminding Frank that he does not feel the same way. Regardless, a lovestruck Frank emotionally discloses the “forever” they spend together that he’s been dreaming of, before sadly pointing out once again how he probably hasn’t been thinking that far ahead.\n\nFurthermore, the road changing from color to black and white represents them sticking together until gay people get the right to marry. They’ll wear black and white, like a bride and groom, instead of the rainbow-colored LGBT flag.\n\nTo bring the song full circle, the road changing colors is another reference to The Wizard of Oz, in which the movie changes to black and white once Dorothy heads back home from Oz.\n\n\n\nGay marriage was ruled legal nationwide in the US in 2015."

However, they’ve broken up and it makes him cry which is as rare as rain in California and Arizona. Interestingly, it was thought his second LP would be titled Boys Don’t Cry, but it ended up being the name of the magazine that went along with Blonde.\n\n“It Never Rains in Southern California” is a song that tells a story of a musician who moved to Cali in pursuit of a music career. The tornado is one of two references to the classic novel/movie “The Wizard of Oz” in this song, in which the main character Dorothy is swept away into the Land of Oz by a tornado.\n\nOnce you put those two references together, and mix water with a tornado, you get a highly influential event that happened to Ocean. After hurricane Katrina hit his hometown of New Orleans, Frank moved to Los Angeles to chase his dream of being a musician.\n\nFurthermore, “It Never Rains in Southern California” contains the following lyrics:\n\nIt never rains in California, but girl, don’t they warn ya?\nIt pours, man, it pours\n\nIn the mentioned lines, “girl” is a vocative, and “man” is just a phrase that is there to amplify the meaning. However, Frank’s usage of “boy” in this verse could be interpreted as both, and that means the love he’s talking about could be male or female. Note that when “Thinkin Bout You” came out as a single it was still unknown if he was straight or not. Prior to the release of channel ORANGE, he came out as bisexual."

I told everyone that I was no longer an addict – including myself – because it was only occasional. But of course those occasions got closer and closer together.” So his claim that he “gets things done” turns out to be a lie.\n\nIt’s a great line, connecting back to “standing in the wind.”\n\nA likely interpretation seems to be a negative progression from ‘standing in the wind’ to ‘lying in the rain’; he tries, but he’s going downhill with the weather & his environment."

Neneh Cherry also appears in the video of the song, playing guitar (with Naomi Campbell, also of the Buffalo Posse, on keyboards.)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJH_cbFm_0\n\nThe Wild Bunch was a sound system based in the St Paul’s district of Bristol, England from 1983 to 1986. They were a key member of what became the Bristol underground scene. It included several notable British DJs and performers, such as:\n\n• Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall, Tricky and Andrew Vowles, of Massive Attack.\n\n• Nellee Hooper, who moved to London after the group’s dissolution and worked as a producer and remixer for a number of major artists, including Madonna,U2, No Doubt, Björk and others.

Not necessarily tough, but hard style taken from the street … a functional and stylish look; non-fashion with a hard attitude.\n\nNeneh Cherry told the New York Times in 2007:\n\nThe song is about our gang, our time and our mentor, Ray, who is still behind every word and every melody “Buffalo meant classic. None of us were into here-today-gone-tomorrow fashion, which is why we gravitated toward each other. Ray was always consistent, and he taught us that we shouldn’t be afraid to be honest.\n\nThe song’s name is also a reference to Malcolm McLaren’s 1983 song “Buffalo Gals”, which is sampled."

The message effectively parallels the light, happy, and upbeat tone of the song, emphasized by the fast tempo and the lack of discordant sound. The unique sound was created through the layering of guitar as well as the use of Sebastian’s auto-harp, an instrument that was also used extensively by Janis Joplin.\n\n\n\nThe message of the song has been one that has persisted throughout modern culture. Not only through recognition from magazines such as Rolling Stone, but also has been covered and featured in TV shows, movies, and commercials on numerous occasions."

The questions are modeled after the kinds of inquiries a judge may put to a murder suspect in order to rule out the likelihood of murder.\n\nAccording to this view, SZA may be drawing comparisons to Bill, who had a relationship with Beatrix but later found out after their split that she was pregnant with his child and had married another man.

[…] There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.\nhttps://youtu.be/yDjrX6mF89o\n\n“I’m still a fan even though I was salty” encapsulates Bill’s feelings about Kiddo. He praises her character often, but still insists on having her dead if she’s not with him.\n\n“Hate to see you happy if I’m not the one drivin'” may also be a subtle reference to Elle Driver, the one-eyed antagonist from the films:\n\n\n\n“Broad” is also phonetically similar to “bride,” which would be a reference to Kiddo’s “the Bride” moniker."

She’s always sought to have others by her side, primarily for validation because of her insecurities, and was always left even more insecure after being dumped. This is something she already sang about in a song “Supermodel” from her previous album Ctrl. On it SZA sings:\n\nWhy I can’t stay alone just by myself?\nWish I was comfortable just with myself\nBut I need you, but I need you, but I need you\n\nIn “Supermodel,” she kept her discomfort of being alone under control and simply wrote a letter to her ex after he left her. But this time she’s committing double homicide. SZA’s not under control anymore as she’s saying it herself in the next track “Seek & Destroy”. She’s gone borderline maniac because of her jealousy and insecurity, prefering to be locked up for life rather than letting her ex go and be happy with another girl.\n\nThe line gets changed in the last Chorus where she switches jail for hell, stating she’d rather die than live her life without him. This change is also increasing the magnitude of how she feels being alone by comparing it to hell – telling us that the loneliness is the ultimate suffering for her."

It’s heavily implied that Bill is doing just that to Beatrix; he’s old enough to masquerade as her father and Beatrix’s last name is literally “Kiddo.” Both SZA and Kiddo’s homicidal need for revenge obviously displays a lack of emotional maturity.\n\nAlternatively, SZA could also be likening herself to Bill. Despite how much older Bill is, his refusal to allow Beatrix to live a happy life without him also displays a lack of emotional maturity."

I took a taxi to the hotel and when I woke up the next morning, I threw back the curtains and saw these beautiful green mountains in the distance. Then, I looked down and there was a parking lot as far as the eye could see, and it broke my heart […] this blight on paradise. That’s when I sat down and wrote the song. When it first came out, it was a regional hit in Hawaii because people there realized their paradise was being chewed up. It took 20 years for that song to sink in to people most other places in the country. That is a powerful little song because there have been cases in a couple of cities of parking lots being torn up and turned into parks because of it."

The engineer said that it meant ‘greetings’ in German, which I thought was lovely and decided to leave in. When I went onstage with it everyone would sing ‘Bruce.’ I just ended up singing ‘Bruce’ as well.\n\nRolling Stone contributor David Wild is also quoted in the liner notes for Flashback:\n\nNo, kids, Lynne’s not singing ‘Bruce’ in the backing vocals for the [Discovery] album’s inspired rocker Don’t Bring Me Down. ‘No,’ [says Jeff Lynne,] ‘it’s groos– just a word I made up in the studio to fill up this hole. Everybody loved it so I left it in. Mack– our great engineer at Musicland– said, How’d you know that? He told me that groos sounded just like the German word for Greetings. But everyone heard it as Bruce and at all the shows I ended up singing it that way too.’\n\nThe lyrics of this line led to numerous comments, many of the better ones can be read here."

When I wrote it, I was trying to get away from this intense situation I’m in. Like, “Ah, I’m just gonna get away from this.” I turn the radio on, and then this woman’s singing my song. I can’t get away from this. But then there’s a little satisfaction because she’s singing my song. She’s singing the same thing that’s happening to me. And I realize this happens to everybody. Everybody goes through those these same things. “The lover’s in love and the other’s run away. The lover is crying cause the other won’t stay.” Everybody goes through this. This is just a human thing that we all are always going through.\n\nIt’s not weird that I became the person singing this song. It’s like I’m Tony the Tiger holding the box of Frosted Flakes and on that box is Tony the Tiger holding a box of Frosted Flakes, and then on that box… So, it’s self-referential. I know. It’s very strange. Also, I remember when I wrote it and I wrote the word “Lover.” Like, “lover” was a word that we all hated using. It was just, kind of a tacky word, in a way. But I wanted to use the word because it was the kind of word you would hear in someone else’s old-school song and it works in that area. But I would never actually use “lover” when it applies to my own music. Sounds kind of like Gilligan’s Island, Mrs. Howell or something."

The longer you stay in the relationship, the more intense the flames become.\n\n\n\n– June Carter in 1963"

They hope that this song will resonate with as many people as possible. During the press conference for the song, member Suga commented saying,\n\nWe want to give strength during these times of difficulty for everyone, so we hope that many people listen to the song and feel comforted.\n\nAnother retro slang term used in these lyrics is “word up,” firstly popularized in hip-hop by Cameo’s eponymous hit song in the 1980s."

Three of Queen’s more repetitive songs –  “We Will Rock You” (1977), “Another One Bites The Dust” (1980), and “Crazy Little Thing Called Love” (1980) – were their most successful songs in the US. Their much less repetitive worldwide hit “Bohemian Rhapsody” (1975), however, only reached a Number 9 position on the US charts in 1976 (No2 in 1992!), while more repetitive Number 1 disco hits  (“That’s The Way (I Like It)” (1975) by KC and the Sunshine Band and “Fly Robin Fly” (1975) by the Silver Convention ) set the trend at that time. “Under Pressure”, Queen’s collaboration with David Bowie, reached a low Number 29 on the US charts in 1982, while the record was a Number 1 hit in the UK.  “Innuendo” had similar story (No 1 vs. No chart appearance). These three songs show that the US single market was not ideal place for Queen’s non-repetitive songs. The famous riff of “Under Pressure” later on returned in a repetitive context as the sample hook in Vanilla Ice’s pop-rap hit “Ice Ice Baby”, an US Number 1 in 1990 and also a telling and extreme example of “less  is more” – on the charts at least."

All my drums are harder than most people’s drums. I gave it the bouncy feeling. It was more sedated before. That’s why the people dance like they do when the record comes on. I brought it back to Wayne and he jumped up on the speakers and was excited and started doing the same dances he’s doing in the video and was like, “That’s the next single. I know we’re supposed to do ‘Showtime,’1 but we’re going to do this one.”\n\n1- “Showtime” presumably refers to “Action,” a bonus track also produced by Deezle that appeared on on some versions of the album.

Looking in the mirror is not, but doing so forces one to face their own problems: Swift is not able to look at herself and confront her weaknesses in the mirror, but can ironically hurt herself by ignoring them – with great strength.\n\nIn 2020, Taylor personified herself as a mirrorball, putting forth the idea that she has no real identity and can “change everything about [herself] to fit in” and conform to what everyone expects of her. If this is the case, looking in the mirror would be confusing – who would you see?\n\nThis is also a nod to “The Archer”:\n\nAnd I cut off my nose just to spite my face\nThen I hate my reflection for years and years\n\nSwift could potentially be referring to the British tabloid newspapers, the “Sun” and the “Mirror”.

In the music video, Taylor sips tea on a throne in an apparent reference to a photo posted online by Kendall Jenner with the caption “tea time” after her half-sister Kim Kardashian shared a phone conversation between Taylor and Kanye West.\n\n\n\n“Look What You Made Me Do” was also the first single from her 2017 album Reputation, where Taylor took the role of a sort of anti-hero and which spawned the term “Reputation era” online as a reference to one’s own real life “villain arc”. The “teatime” in question is likely referring to the ways people, both those Taylor knows and those she doesn’t, talk about her behind her back, and the fact that she has become so ubiquitous that idle chatter about her being the cause of her problems has become commonplace. Based on the fact that her “midnights became her afternoons”, which implies that she wakes up at around 4 p.m., and the fact that traditional English upper class teatime generally takes place at 11 a.m., those engaging in teatime are badmouthing her while she’s not even awake."

Fans on Twitter and critics noted the similarities between the two as well.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNwQyNMSUmg&ab_channel=Movieclips\n\nAccording to the Forbes Celebrity 100, Taylor was the 25th-highest-paid celebrity in the world in 2020, earning $63,500,000 that year alone. Unfortunately, because of this, the idea of an in-law offing her for her money isn’t entirely farfetched, which is likely why she has recurring nightmares about it.\n\nA scene from the music video expands on the specifics of this dream, with her imagined children Kimber, Chad, and Preston all fighting at her funeral over the 13¢ she left them after presumably being pushed off her balcony by Kimber. Each of her children exploits her legacy in a different way: Chad writes a book called Growing Up Swift and records a podcast called Life Comes at You Swiftly, Preston uses Taylor’s name to get entry into a country club, and Kimber wears Taylor’s outfit and hair from the Fearless Tour in 2009."

                        "plain": "In keeping with the track’s themes of self-loathing and self-criticism, Swift magnifies another flaw she sees within herself: inauthenticity.\n\nThe phrase “did you hear” is often associated with celebrity gossip and scandalous tabloids, which are known to capitalize on the less-flattering parts of people’s lives. In these lines, Swift may be assuming the role of the media to be self-critical and publicize her own faults and shortcomings.\n\nNarcissism is the excessive interest in or admiration of oneself. Altruism is the belief in or practice of disinterested and selfless concern for the well-being of others. Here, Swift labels herself as a “covert narcissist,” which is a psychological designation for people with narcissistic personality disorder who display fewer external symptoms, or who “conceal” their narcissism (as opposed to an overt narcissist). A covert narcissist might try to make their self-serving behaviors seem “altruistic” in order to gain approval from others.\n\nThe comparison to a “congressman” in the following line serves a similar purpose, as politicians are infamous for being deceitful and hiding their true intentions from voters. Here, Swift is making a jab at both herself and political figures who ignore the will of the people to push their own agendas.\n\nAware of her sway as a major public figure, Swift was notably publicly apolitical for the majority of her career. 2018 marked a major turning point for Swift, who broke her political silence via Instagram shortly before the Tennessee midterm elections to endorse Democrats Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper for Senate and House of Representatives, respectively.\n\nIn the post, Taylor wrote,\n\nIn the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now…For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.\n\nSwift also spoke about the idea of political deception during her Miss Americana documentary when talking about Tennessee senator Marsha Blackburn:\n\nI can’t see another commercial and see her disguising these policies behind the words “Tennessee Christian values.” Those aren’t Tennessee Christian values. I live in Tennessee. I am Christian. That’s not what we stand for.\n\nDuring a comedic bit at the end of Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, Red Tour Taylor calls out Fearless Tour Taylor for similar inauthenticity:\n\nOh, stop acting like you’re all nice. You are so fake."

By practically saying “its not really my fault” he is positioning himself better for when he makes basic promises (like not sleeping around) and asks her to keep the expectations low.\nHe wants to win her back, but his jealousy is affecting his speech and it is frustrating.\n\n\n\nThe line “Hey jealousy” contextualises the whole song- this is a man’s pathetic and frustrated attempt to try and pull back what he once had, being ruined by his own mental instability and negative thoughts."

The best I could come up with is that the girl’s name is “Jealousy” and that she had Hippie parents. How many great songs about lost love the title is the other person’s name. But that’s not it.\n\nSee their other big hit off this album is a song about cheating “Found out about you”. He was totally into her, until he her whispers at the bus stop, found out about nights out at the schoolyard. Right? JEALOUSY. If you listen to that song alone, it’s the song of a jaded male who thought he was in love while the girl didn’t seem that interested in him.\n\nBut if the next song you hear is this one, it takes a new meaning. He was the jealous lover in the other song. Demeaning his love, but that was the action that drove her away, causing him to get drunk and show up on her doorstep to express this song.\n\n“Hey jealousy” is him bemoaning the emotion of jealousy that screwed up his whole life, by screwing up this one relationship, by living “Found out about you”. Hence the wail on “jealousy,” it is his own jealousy he’s angry at.\n\nNow if I can just figure out what the “one thing I couldn’t start” means."

However on the words, “I thought that I heard you laughing,” the song features its first sustained major chord, often characterized as having a “happy” sound.  However the singers happiness doesn’t last long; the happy major chord is simply a momentary wishful self-deception.

It’s an impolite entrance, a skipping of preamble and niceties.\n\nSomeBODY once told me the world was gonna roll me …\n\nBoth the record label and the radio stations hated it. “[Radio DJs] like to talk over the beginning of your song,” [songwriter Greg] Camp said. “Which made me fight for that even more. You know: ‘Well, they should shut up when our song plays.’”\n\n\nThe article also reveals Camp’s inspirations for this approach:\n\nOne track in particular stood out: Barenaked Ladies’ “One Week,” with its hyper-verbose verses and abrupt mood shifts, and the fact that the vocals kicked in before the music did. (The other group brazenly vocalizing right at top of songs that year was ’NSync. Smash Mouth would tour with them in 2002.)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL2IZ6-QvjU\n\nThe opening is so iconic that Camp has said:\n\n[Now vocalist Steve Harwell] just walks out on stage and says the word “Some,” and the crowd will finish the song for you. They’ll sing the entire song. My hair still stands up when that happens.\n\nThe line became a meme on TikTok where there was a trend of extending the time between “Some” and the rest of the verse to show funny videos and similar stuff."

And all of a sudden it was on a record and I didn’t change it.\n\nOne interpretation: one does not rise to great success (to “shine”) unless one takes chances and puts in the effort to achieve more modest goals first (to “glow”). These terms fit well with the song’s star theme."

I was in a relationship and I was playing in bands and stuff like that. Every morning this person that I was with would have to get up and go to work, and I would be able to just kind of stay in bed because I didn’t work until later. I was playing in bands that made money, like cover bands and wedding bands and things like that.

I think that things have changed a lot. He debuted as the number one single recently—that’s amazing. I think the song brought it all back together and it’s really helping him. Not that we was never likable, but he had so many things surrounding him that were negative. We’ve kind of made him cool again and made it so that he was likable again.

So I would just go from the top of the song all the way down. I was never flying in hooks. Everything was live, one take. If I got all the way to the fucking end, and messed up the last word, I’d be like “Run it back, let’s do it again.” I remember Dre was like “Yo, are you fucking crazy? Let’s just punch.” I didn’t like that concept because I wasn’t used to it. When we were recording here in Detroit, in the beginning, I was saving up my money to go in. We only had an hour, you know?

We always have this discussion, because Dre says it’s four.\n\nPaul used to live in New Jersey, right across from Manhattan. He had an apartment he shared with three roommates. I was over, sleeping on the couch. We didn’t have money yet, really. We had already filmed the video, and we saw it for the first time on MTV. It came on really late at night. I was sleeping on the couch when Paul saw it for the first time.\n\nThat’s when it was like, “Okay, this isn’t a joke anymore.” We had kind of felt that, being in the studio with Dre and shit. But once that single came out, my life changed like that. Within a day. Just going outside. I couldn’t go outside anymore. In a day. It went from the day before, doing whatever the fuck I wanted to do, because nobody knew who the fuck I was, to holy shit, people are fucking following us. It was crazy. That’s when shit just got really — it was a lot to deal with at once.\n\nRight after the first single came out, I did a signing at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.

I loved it and played it for my little daughter who was six years old. I asked her, “Pick the songs that you like for Jennifer.”  She picked that one and “I’m Real.” Originally, the song was called “Jenny from the Bronx” and I felt like that was a little too corny, so I changed the lyrics and I changed it to “Jenny from the Block” and changed a few things to make it fit her more specifically.

By juxtaposing the last two lines of the section with the first two, Justman highlights the contrast between how he perceived his “homeroom angel” in his original memory and how he perceived her after seeing the photograph, again setting up the chorus which directly validates the theme with the line “my memory has just been sold.”"

When he was in Genesis, Peter Gabriel was writing intricate and progressive musical pieces, and performing elaborate shows with detailed costumes and over-the-top performances. His departure from the band ultimately stemmed from his opposition to the poppier, hit-oriented music the rest of the band was embracing.\n\nOver the course of his solo career, Peter Gabriel eventually grew more into pop himself. He compares the simple, satisfying feeling of pop music to sex. By leaving behind prog, he “kicked the habit”, and “shed his skin”, reinventing his own identity as a musician."

And I told Willie [Hall], the drummer … I said, give me that high-hat, man, some 16 notes, you know? (Vocalizing). And he did that. And it worked. I said, that’s the kind of dramatic effect I want.

I’ve been with you for however many years, blah blah blah, I’m used to this.” Then all of a sudden, for argument’s sake again, they’re not there.

I’m very guarded and I’m an over-thinker. If I get into a situation and something doesn’t feel right, I’ll automatically close my doors. Which is a good and a bad thing in some situations, but the reason I said “No, this ain’t really like me” is because when you get into that first initial stage of really liking someone and falling for them, I think everyone, being human, has their doubts where they’re like, “Maybe I’m falling too fast, maybe the other person doesn’t feel the same way. I don’t know what it really is.”\n\nI am still quite young; I’m 23, so I’ve only been in two real relationships. I can’t really explain it and I find it really hard to explain love as well and explain your feelings because I feel like it’s kind of better left unsaid; It’s just a feeling. If you know it and the person knows it; that’s what the whole song is, really. Just everything I haven’t had before and all the new experiences that I hadn’t experienced before in a relationship. I didn’t know what it was, so I couldn’t really say “Okay, it’s this, it’s that.” I just had this feeling, but I didn’t know what it was."

He feels that flying in a private jet, which many would see as a dream, has become burdensome or uncomfortable for him. By saying he’d rather “take my chances in traffic,” he implies that he prefers the unpredictability of everyday life over the pressures and isolation that come with his celebrity status. This reflects a deeper commentary on the costs of success and the desire for a more authentic experience.\n\nRoddy often explores these themes in his other songs too. For instance, in “War Baby,” he talks about the pressure and the darker side of fame, mentioning feelings of loneliness and paranoia. In “Every Season,” he captures the transition from a difficult past to a more prosperous present while still grappling with the realities of his new life. These elements reinforce the sentiment in “The Box” about the complexities of fame and longing for authenticity amidst the glitz."

Although the girl is the most beautiful thing the songwriter has ever seen, he can’t do anything about it. He shows that even when we are at the beautiful beaches of Rio, we are still affected by loneliness."

She said, ‘Have a seat’ and we talked about music. I wrote ‘You Get What You Give’ the same day.”\n\nIn a strange cosmic coincidence, Joni Mitchell said that hearing the song on the radio stopped her from quitting music in 1999. She said it rose “from the swamp of ‘McMusic’ like a flower of hope” and was “the only thing I heard in many years that I thought had greatness in it”.\n\n“At the time this song became popular, I no longer played my instruments and I had no desire to sing or to listen to music. I listened to public radio and changed the station if they played music. But music is everywhere – in stores, even in traffic with the window down – and so I managed to hear this song. It was the first thing I had heard in decades that seemed to be inspired by something greater than personal ambition. It was sassy and smart and had real emotions.”\n-Joni Mitchell\n\nIn 2000, she also told Rolling Stone:\n\n“That’s the first song since I was a teenager that I rushed to the radio to turn up. I like the harmony, I like the passion in his voice. I love that song, you know, ‘you got the music in you’,  and I love the punk irreverence of it. Now that’s my kind of punky white boy.”\n\nAlexander recounted his experience meeting Mitchell, who approached him at a Grammy’s gala:\n\n“After that, I met her. I told her about the dream and she said, ‘Oh wonderful’, like she has coincidences like that every day. She must be some kind of lightning rod for all these magical things.”\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/mar/04/murder-on-the-dancefloor-gregg-alexander-saltburn-obamas-joni-mitchell#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20almost%20flipped%20a%20coin,to%20say%20inside%20five%20minutes.%E2%80%9D\n\nhttps://faroutmagazine.co.uk/britpop-hit-stopped-joni-mitchell-quitting-music/"

                        "plain": "The song prior to “Your Love” takes an opposite take from the perspective that this song is delivering. In “Say It Isn’t So” the narrator sings from the point of view of a guy that is worried and paranoid of his lover being unfaithful to him. Whereas in this song the narrator sings from the perspective of a guy that is lonely while his lover is away and goes on in an attempt to persuade a separate love interest into spending a night with him so he can numb the pain of being alone. I wouldn’t go as far as saying the narrator is cheating in spite of his significant other but he is rather acting upon a feeling of loneliness or a loss of feeling love and has so decided that a night spent with whom he’s singing to, will solve his despair for the time being."

He went on to blame then WWF president Jack Tunney for losing the title due to “outside interference” in the form of sabotage by sending George “The Animal” Steele to help Steamboat during the match.\n\nIn a similar vein, it can be argued that House of Pain was “sabotaged” by Ruffhouse Records CEO Joe Nicolo (who was called out during the outro of Jump Around) for rejecting their demo of the song, then turning around and playing it for Jermaine Dupri who went on to produce Jump for Kris Kross upon his request to produce something similar to the demo.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C4lK41SX-Q"

And I said, “What the hell are you talking about?” And he quoted the first line of Is She Really Going Out With Him — “Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street” — which he thought was about black guys with white girls, that I was a racist. And no matter what I said he wouldn’t believe me, and as far as he was concerned that was what it was. So, I mean, really, what can you do?

The gay clubs in New York had the best underground music, so Rodgers frequented them to find out what the next big thing music would be. After seeing three different drag queens dressed as Diana Ross, Rodgers imagined what it would be like if Ross were to come out of the closet…\n\n‘Diana Ross is not gay, so her singing “I’m Coming Out” was not about coming out of the closet,’ said Rodgers. ‘But it was like she was coming out of another form of the closet because she was leaving Motown and she had been under the thumb of Berry Gordy her whole life and this was the one thing she had done on her own.’\n\n\n–Express Gay News (1993)"

Aquarius is the true age of knowledge. In this age, dogmatic types of religion will cease to be taught, and all dogmatic forms will disappear. Science and religion will merge and people will begin to comprehend that spirit and matter are derived from the same source, and are only modifications of the One Universal Energy. It is the desire to pool and merge the time, efforts, and resources of the individual with those of the larger society in order to create something new for the benefit of everyone. Enhancement of the polity overwhelms the desire for self-aggrandizement, and the wall of Ego come tumbling down and the individual communes with the totality of the species.\n\nAlso per the aforementioned site – the essence of the change in ages is –\n\nIf Pisces can be described as the age of revelation versus reason, then the Aquarius age will be the age of collective integrity versus individual dignity.  In the Piscean Age, we looked to have our minds and souls revealed to us, either through our imaginations or interpretations of Divinity. Reason was the counterfoil to that impulse.  In the Aquarian Age, I believe we will strive more to condition our minds to be better integrated into the collective.  In the Piscean age, the key question was, “What do you believe?”  In the Aquarian age, the question will be, “How are we connected?”\n\n\n\nIt is a utopian view, and all preceding ages and the current one (Age of Pisces) had less than 5% days with no wars and mayhem. Unlikely that the coming Age of Aquarius will be any different.\n\nAstrologically, we are towards the end of Age Pisces – around 6% left, which computes to a few hundred years, therefore we are in a long transition period…"

And this version is still about it. The singer can’t stop thinking about the words her crush said. Probably her feelings are mutual and her crush confessed her love to her, so she can’t stop thinking about it and the main problem is homophobia from everyone around including her family."

She stated, “I think being on a plane and knowing she passed away after a plane crash, there was just this sentiment of being present in the moment and really nothing else matters but those that you love. I think that feeling was really present in my life at that time and really right in my face.” The lyric, “Some people need three dozen roses, And that’s the only way to prove you love them” stands to mean that people care more about the physical and materialistic things and three dozen roses should be enough to express your love to someone, but that shouldn’t be the case. On top of Aaliyah’s death, 9/11 had also occurred which had a huge impact on everyone. These lyrics remind us all to not wait until it is too late to actually make time and show those we love them that we’re here and that we do in fact love them without the materialistic things."

                        "plain": "That is to say: “There’s hope for you in Memphis.”\n\nIt is as though the lyrics suggest: When it seems there’s not a hope or prayer for you in the world, Memphis has a hope or prayer for you, mostly in from the sense of a church or religious non-segregation standpoint. This lyrics is Reverend Green’s offering, as a sentiment for the traveling narrator, as reminder for his journey ahead of him, on this visit and the next.\n\nIt’s a welcoming expression and delivers a sense of communal friendliness, also known as southern hospitality. It would likely comfort someone from out of town, like the song’s narrator, who appears to be interacting with people from different origins.\n\nIf Reverend Green were black, for example, Marc Cohn, as the song’s narrator, delivers the lyrical message of this lyric being a turning point.\n\nAfter this lyric, the song’s narrator begins to further understand that the nuances of Memphis are what the streets can’t fully offer. Despite the rich culture   and landmark attractions, the lyrics and arrangements offer a sense of pondering beyond city’s “Main Street” attractions.\n\nFrom my perspective as the listener, I feel there is a crescendo of abandon by Marc Cohn himself, as he realizes the unprejudiced facets of Memphis' many accepting cultural offerings, including unprejudiced people, the increased spiritualization of him having realized what he realized about Memphis, is felt by me from both the lyric and delivery standpoint, in addition to the overall emotional progression of the song."

His stellar career ended suddenly in June 1966 when he was arrested and later charged along with being convicted for murder. The trial was widely publicized and many believed he was innocent. The conviction of Carter sparked nationwide protests. According to the book, Damn Good Advice (For People With Talent), famous advertiser George Lois one night convinced Bob Dylan to bring awareness to the situation. The outcome was “Hurricane”, one of Dylan’s most recognizable tracks."
